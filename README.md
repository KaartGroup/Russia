# Russia Mapping Projects
This repository tracks the various mapping projects throughout Russia that are managed by [Kaart](https://github.com/KaartGroup/Russia/blob/master/KAART.md "Kaart").

## Projects

### [Road Alignment Project](https://github.com/KaartGroup/Russia/projects/1 "Project 1")
Based on Kaart GIS analysis, the Russia road network data has positional errors (>5m) when compared to existing track logs (OpenStreetMap and Strava), and may also include incorrect topology that does not match aerial imagery.

#### Contributors
The project is open to OpenStreetMap contributors of any experience level.

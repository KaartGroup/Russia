### Scope of Editing
The bulk of the work deals with creating missing geometry, however, we are also concerned with ensuring that the fea\
tures have the correct attributes and are the correct classification. Additionally, the data should be as free of er\
rors as possible - namely having appropriate connectivity and alignment. Any other issues encountered by the editor \
should be resolved using the standardized guidelines outlined by the [OSM Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/H\
ighways "OSM"), [WikiProject Russia](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/RU:%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%\
BE%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F "RU") and the Kaart [Data Team Guidelines](https://github.\
com/KaartGroup/Moldova/blob/master/KAART.md#data-team-guidelines                                                     
 "Guidelines").

### Validation
The JOSM validation tool is used to [validate](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Validator#Validations "Valid\
ators") errors and warnings that may have been created during the editing process. The contributor will run this val\
idation and fix any errors or warnings prior to any changes being uploaded.

### Contributors
The project is open to OpenStreetMap contributors of any experience level.

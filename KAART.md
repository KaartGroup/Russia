## Kaart
Kaart is a small team of active mappers contributing to foundational data in OpenStreetMap, primarily in road networks. We don't make automated edits or bulk imports to JOSM as we believe a human element is necessary in making awesome data.

##  Data Team Guidelines
In addition to the community rules that all contributors must abide by, the Kaart team implements their own standards which are as follows:

- **Make Awesome Data** Our mission is to provide the highest quality data by adhering to the standards documented in the [OSM Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org) as well as local specifications that vary by country.
- **Local knowledge first** We travel and collect our own source data using GPS enabled cameras and staff in-country.
- All **full-time data team members** are listed on the [Kaart OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Kaart#Kaart_Data_Team) page and identified on their user profiles.
- **Transparency** We use public tools and will happily share our experiences and processes with local mappers to help grow communities.
- **Working with the local community** Often, when conducting groundwork in a country, we will try to meet local editors and collaborate with them when possible. We seek to understand the local mapping conventions and assist in uplifting OSM data to a more complete standard.
